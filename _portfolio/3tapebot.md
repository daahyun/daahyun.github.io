**Background**<br>
<div style="text-align: left">
Many robotic kits enable children to design various robotic characters with plenty of flexibility and creativity, such as humanoids, robotic animals, and robotic faces. However, because a robot is an artifact that perceives an environment and responds to it accordingly, it can also be characterized by the environment it encounters.

**Design Concept**
<div style="text-align: left">
We propose a modular robotic kit that is aimed at creating an interactive environment for which a robot produces various responses. <br>
We chose intelligent tapes to build the environment for the following reasons:<br>
1. We believe that the tape, which is found in everyday life, is a perfect material to lower the consumers’ expectation toward the product and will be helpful for the consumer’s acceptance of it.<br>
2. The tape is a familiar and enjoyable material for children, and it can be used as a flexible module, which users can cut into whatever size they want and can be attached and detached with ease.
