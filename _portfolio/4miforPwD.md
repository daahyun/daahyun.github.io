Intelligent product for measuring the symptom of dementia(IPSD) measures changes in dietary habits, sleep patterns, and athletic performance abilities of the dementia patient, respectively without changing patientsâ€™ environment.

**Background**
In modern society, as the average life span of people has been steadily increasing due to the development of medical technology, the cost of dementia treatment and burden of dementia care has become a social problem. In case of patients with dementia (PwD), early diagnosis is important. After early diagnosis, proper treatment can relieve the symptoms of dementia and slow the progress of the disease. Robotic technology can help to get diagnosis early, and treatment appropriately. However, A robot is a very new concept object to the ordinary people except for engineers and robot experts. In addition, environmental changes can give a negative impact on PwD. Therefore, rather than putting the robot-like robot into PwD's environment, it may be more effective for patient care to interact with the familiar products.

**Design Concept**
IPSDs were designed by applying robotic technology to daily necessities since products which are familiar to the user allow interaction with the user continuously and regularly, to measure the symptoms of dementia.
